Racoon Tool 

is a perl wrapper script for managing setkey and racoon as found on FreeBSD,
and Debian systems.  In Debian it is shipped as part of the racoon package, and
is available as a port on FreeBSD. It is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2.

It makes the management of IPSEC for the common tasks of small VPN hubs and
networks easier, and was originally inspired by FreeSWAN.

It is fully documented in the sample racoon-tool.conf, and provided man pages
and source code.

It depends on the standard Perl 5.x install found on almost all systems, and I
believe that it may run with only the perl5-minimal package on Debian and
Ubuntu. 

To install, just type make install.
